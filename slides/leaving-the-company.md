## Leaving Growella
<!-- .element: style="color: #fff; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #222;" -->

Note:

* After a few short months, I realized Growella wasn't what I needed
* Weekly commute to Cincinnati (2hr) was painful
* Isolating being the only technical person
    - Was exceeding expectations, delaying need to expand
    - New hires would ideally be in the office
