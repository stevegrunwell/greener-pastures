## One day, I get an email&hellip;

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Startup focusing on lead-gen
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> WordPress-based
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Nothing yet built
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Ability to build a team

Note:

* Email from Dan Green, who got my name from a mutual acquaintance
* Lead-gen can be lucrative, but I didn't have experience in the space
* Blank slate
* Ability to build team after initial build
