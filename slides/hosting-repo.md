#### Growella Systems

* Private git repository
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> README with provisioning steps, resources
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Snippets + scripts
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Troubleshooting steps

Note:

* System info, even though I was the only sysadmin
* If someone else came on, I could explain how our systems were set up
* Track changes to the process over time
* Include scripts + snippets that can automate parts
    - Didn't feel a provisioning tool like Ansible was necessary
