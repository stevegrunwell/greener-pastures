    - <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> [Keep some distance](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=394686&u=1518741&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Flexibility v. Stability

    - Didn't want to be abused as backchannel
* Less flexibility, but ultimately safer if no sysadmin is present
