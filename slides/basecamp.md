Note:

* Checked all of our boxes
    - Super-friendly interface, easy to work with, reliable
* Had worked with Basecamp 2 before, which was awful for software teams
    - Not my choice for a software development team, but good for a business
* $99/month with no user or usage limits == super flexible
* Wunderlist == too consumer-grade
