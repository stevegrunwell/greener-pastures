## General Philosophy

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Inexpensive, but not cheap
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> One person can't scale
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Strong beliefs, loosely held

Note:

1. Be cost-effective without sacrificing quality
    - Both initial cost and long-term maintenance costs
2. The less I have to worry about maintaining, the better
    - Constant trade-off
3. Don't be so tied to something imperfect that you can't move later
    - Data export features
    - Document why decisions were made
    - Be willing to re-evaluate over time
