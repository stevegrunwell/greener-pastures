### Email updates

* [Available WordPress updates](https://engineering.growella.com/wp-cli-update-check/)
* [WPScan Vulnerability Database](https://wpvulndb.com/)
* Assorted security newsletters

Note:

* Emails beyond alerts
    - Cron script to have WP-CLI check for available updates and email a daily report
    - WPVulnDB for WordPress-related vulnerabilities
    - Security newsletters to ensure we're keeping up-to-date
* Emails went to systems@ alias so they weren't just tied to me
    - Curated so the list wouldn't be overwhelming or annoying.
